# Voice Settings

The application supports both local and cloud-based voice synthesis methods. You can choose the appropriate voice solution based on your needs.

## Local Voice

Local voice uses the device's built-in voice engine and can be used without internet connection.

### Android System Settings
Before using local voice, please complete the following preparations:

1. Install Chinese TTS and Voice Packages

Typically, your phone system comes with a TTS engine, but it only has one voice, which is not suitable for dialogue scenarios. Therefore, we need to install an additional TTS engine.

   - Go to System Settings
   - Find Language and Input settings
   - Check TTS engines, if there's only one, you need to install another TTS engine

2. Recommended voice engines:

   - Xiaomi Voice Engine (can be downloaded from [here](https://www.52pojie.cn/thread-1683594-1-1.html), third-party software, please assess risks yourself)
   - Google Text-to-Speech Engine (can be downloaded from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.voiceservices))

   * Note: Although Xiaomi Voice Engine can be used offline, it connects to the internet by default for better results. It's free but may incur data charges.

### iOS System
iOS system comes with Chinese voice engine, no additional setup needed.

### Voice Parameter Settings
You can adjust the following parameters to achieve the best voice effect:

- Speech Rate: Adjust the speed of voice playback
- Pitch: Adjust the pitch of the voice
- Volume: Adjust the volume of the voice

## Cloud Voice

Cloud voice uses AI technology to generate more natural voice effects and requires internet connection.

### Preparation
1. Fill in API Key in the settings interface
   - Can use API Key from SiliconFlow.cn, a domestic AI company

2. Enable "Use Cloud TTS" option

### Voice Parameter Settings
Cloud voice also supports adjusting:
- Speech Rate
- Pitch
- Volume

Note that currently many AI model interfaces don't support these parameters. We adjust them during playback, so they are not supported when exporting audio.

## Character Customization

You can set different voice characteristics and personalized settings for both host and assistant.

### Host/Assistant Settings
- Set Name: Choose an appropriate name for the role
- Personality Traits: Customize the character's personality
- Expression Style: Adjust the tone and style of speech

## Optimization Settings

In the settings interface, you can also enable the following features to optimize voice effects:

- Secondary Polish: Use AI to optimize generated dialogues for more natural flow
- Auto Translation: Can automatically translate non-Chinese content (if needed)
