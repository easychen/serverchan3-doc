# Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Is ServerChan³ free? If not, what's the pricing model?</strong></summary>

ServerChan³ includes both push notification service and AI service. Different services have different pricing models:

1. The push notification service is **free during the testing period**. The official version will be charged according to the same pricing as ServerChan<sup>Turbo</sup>(sct.ftqq.com). Subscribers of ServerChan<sup>Turbo</sup> **don't need to pay again**, we will provide a solution to sync the membership period to ServerChan³.
2. AI-related features (such as summarization and translation) **consume points regardless of testing period** ([pricing details](https://apijia.cn/doc)). New users get free points upon registration, and need to purchase more points when they run out.

<summary><strong>What's the relationship between ServerChan³（sc3.ft07.com）and ServerChan<sup>Turbo</sup>(sct.ftqq.com)?</strong></summary>

- ServerChan³ is a brand new product line focusing on **native client experience**. It currently supports AI summarization, translation, and image reading mode, along with a Tag-based message grouping system.
- ServerChan<sup>Turbo</sup> focuses on **multi-channel push notifications** primarily through WeChat.

Their users and SendKeys are **not interchangeable**. For the API, except that ServerChan³'s API URL requires adding `uid` in the domain name, most parameters are compatible with ServerChan<sup>Turbo</sup>.

<details>
<summary><strong>What are "Client Messages" and "Server Messages" in ServerChan³? What's the difference?</strong></summary>
1. This relates to how ServerChan³ works - messages are first pushed to the server and cached for 72 hours
1. Then when the client starts or refreshes, it pulls messages from the server and saves them to the local database
1. The message list page displays messages from the local database, so you can browse historical messages even offline
1. In settings, "Clear Client Messages Only" allows you to pull messages from the server again after refreshing; while "Clear All Client + Server Messages" also deletes cached messages on the server, making them unavailable to other clients

<details>
<summary><strong>How to add line breaks when pushing messages? Are tables supported? What's the format?</strong></summary>
1. ServerChan³ uses [flutter_markdown<sup>0.7.4</sup>](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_markdown) to render Markdown and supports [Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), but HTML is not allowed. Format like <a href="..."></a> is HTML and needs to be converted to Markdown format.
1. Note that in Markdown, you need two line breaks `\n\n` for a new paragraph.
1. You can send HTML to AI for conversion help.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How to include images when pushing messages?</strong></summary>
1. ServerChan³ doesn't support base64 as image URLs. You need to upload the image to get an accessible URL, then use Markdown syntax through the `desp` parameter to push it. Note that other parameters don't support Markdown and are only shown on the message detail page.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The `desp` parameter uses Markdown but looks messy on the message card, what should I do?</strong></summary>
1. You can use the `short` parameter to specify the exact text to display in the content section of the message card.
1. Please refer to the parameters section in the [API documentation](/serverchan3/server/api).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How to delete or edit message Tags?</strong></summary>
1. Message Tags are automatically aggregated from the tags contained in messages
1. When all messages containing a certain Tag are deleted, the Tag will disappear
1. Similarly, because they come from automatic aggregation, Tag names cannot be manually modified
