## App Store Installation and Manual Installation

Please visit the [official download page](https://sc3.ft07.com/client):
- If your phone brand has a corresponding app store, you can click the corresponding button to download from the store or search for "ServerChan";
- If not, you can download the APK directly and install it manually.

The app store package and the direct download package are exactly the same. Due to review processes, the app store version might be one or two days behind the latest version
