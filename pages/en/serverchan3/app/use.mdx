After logging in, the main interface defaults to the message list page. This page lists all messages retrieved from the server via API, and automatically processes them as follows:
- **Message Preview**: Each message shows a title and preview of the content. If the message contains images, it will attempt to extract and display thumbnails.
- **Auto Update**: The app will fetch the latest messages from the server when starting up and when switching pages, updating the list.
- **Data Localization**: All messages retrieved from the server are stored in the local database, allowing you to browse and manage messages even without a network connection.

By default, all messages are listed, but you can filter by "Unread" or "Starred".

### Search Function:
There's a search box at the top of the message list that supports keyword search in message titles and content.

## 3. Message Reading
Clicking any message in the message list will take you to the message reading page. This page not only supports basic text display and image viewing but also provides rich interactive features and auxiliary tools.

### Basic Features:
- **Markdown Display**: Message content supports Markdown format, allowing formatted text, links, images, and other multimedia elements.

<Callout type="info">
1. ServerChanÂ³ uses [flutter_markdown<sup>0.7.4</sup>](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_markdown) to render Markdown.
1. Note that in Markdown, you need two line breaks `\n\n` for a new paragraph. HTML syntax is not supported, format like <a href="..."></a> is HTML and needs to be converted to Markdown format.
1. You can send HTML to AI for conversion help.
